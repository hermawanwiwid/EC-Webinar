The first one of these has a global scope, and the second of them is a local variable within the <code>getBandRating</code> function. Within the <code>getBandRating</code> function, the local variable takes precedence. **Deep Purple** will receive a rating of 10.0 when passed to the <code>getBandRating</code> function. However, outside of the <code>getBandRating</code> function, the <code>getBandRating</code> s local variable is not defined, so the <code>myFavouriteBand</code> variable we print is the global variable, which has a value of **AC/DC**:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"7D-W2oR3bPsY"},"source":["# Example of global variable and local variable with the same name\n","\n","myFavouriteBand = \"AC/DC\"\n","\n","def getBandRating(bandname):\n","    myFavouriteBand = \"Deep Purple\"\n","    if bandname == myFavouriteBand:\n","        return 10.0\n","    else:\n","        return 0.0\n","\n","print(\"AC/DC's rating is:\",getBandRating(\"AC/DC\"))\n","print(\"Deep Purple's rating is: \",getBandRating(\"Deep Purple\"))\n","print(\"My favourite band is:\",myFavouriteBand)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QIaZxs94bPsa"},"source":["# <h2>Quiz on Functions</h2>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IiqCldtBbPsc"},"source":["Come up with a function that divides the first input by the second input:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"j1AwcFMybPsd"},"source":["# Write your code below and press Shift+Enter to execute"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"O6eQqB0pbPsg"},"source":["Double-click __here__ for the solution.\n","\n","<!-- \n","def div(a, b):\n","    return(a/b)\n","-->"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TYv3fcPQbPsh"},"source":["<hr>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_lyf9CHPbPsh"},"source":["Use the function <code>con</code> for the following question."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"39qrH5Y5bPsi"},"source":["# Use the con function for the following question\n","\n","def con(a, b):\n","    return(a + b)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0EpyaUJHbPsk"},"source":["Can the <code>con</code> function we defined before be used to add to integers or strings?"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"JvFaw8_ZbPsl","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1570438496259,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":751,"user":{"displayName":"Hermawan Wiwit Nugroho","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDBF2iGKxGl7CYsDDE_vc-IJ_jasiS_LErJsAvk2w=s64","userId":"12590553655837929904"}},"outputId":"8ef1463c-d5ff-4bf6-8a06-bac9a96347c3"},"source":["# Write your code below and press Shift+Enter to execute\n","\n","print(con(1,2))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["3\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tMCFUcKDbPsq"},"source":["Double-click __here__ for the solution.\n","\n","<!-- \n","yes, for example: \n","con(2, 2)\n"," -->"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wfJ1HIiCbPsr"},"source":["<hr>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"I9x8sZegbPss"},"source":["Can the <code>con</code> function we defined before be used to concentrate a list or tuple?"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"p_nQssNebPst","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":51},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1570438572888,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":866,"user":{"displayName":"Hermawan Wiwit Nugroho","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDBF2iGKxGl7CYsDDE_vc-IJ_jasiS_LErJsAvk2w=s64","userId":"12590553655837929904"}},"outputId":"f59e4a0a-f573-4d26-c810-88e147cbf984"},"source":["# Write your code below and press Shift+Enter to execute\n","\n","print(con((1,2),(7,8)))\n","print(con([2,3],[4,5]))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["(1, 2, 7, 8)\n","[2, 3, 4, 5]\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"zs7DbtWLYIxF","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":68},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1570437651666,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":2781,"user":{"displayName":"Hermawan Wiwit Nugroho","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDBF2iGKxGl7CYsDDE_vc-IJ_jasiS_LErJsAvk2w=s64","userId":"12590553655837929904"}},"outputId":"9aa8d873-3ba5-42e8-fb77-1b1f053e9282"},"source":["# Program to multiply two matrices using nested loops\n","\n","# 3x3 matrix\n","X = [[12,7,3],\n","    [4 ,5,6],\n","    [7 ,8,9]]\n","# 3x4 matrix\n","Y = [[5,8,1,2],\n","    [6,7,3,0],\n","    [4,5,9,1]]\n","# result is 3x4\n","result = [[0,0,0,0],\n","         [0,0,0,0],\n","         [0,0,0,0]]\n","\n","# iterate through rows of X\n","for i in range(len(X)):\n","   #

However, there is one more thing you need to do. The Data Science community encourages sharing work. The best way to share and showcase your work is to share it on GitHub. By sharing your notebook on GitHub you are not only building your reputation with fellow data scientists, but you can also show it off when applying for a job. Even though this was your first piece of work, it is never too early to start building good habits. So, please read and follow <a href=\"https://cognitiveclass.ai/blog/data-scientists-stand-out-by-sharing-your-notebooks/\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a> to learn how to share your work.\n","<hr>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CXiq5kYAbPs3"},"source":["<p>Copyright &copy; 2018 IBM Developer Skills Network.
